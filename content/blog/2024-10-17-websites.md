I've been revamping this website and my internet presence. 
For most of my career I didn't care if anyone found my projects or my writing.
Unsurprisingly, this website has been buried (maybe rightly so!)

I assumed that if you made a website that Google would index it.
This, it turns out, isn't quite true (lol). 

So I've been doing some house cleaning on this little corner of the internet.

1. Google Search Console
    1. Made a sitemap.xml using a pelican [plugin](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/sitemap)
    2. Setup https. I don't really care but there's a button you can click on GitHub Pages settings so at least it's easy.
    3. Got crawled and indexed
    4. I need a "canonical" urls. I like the classic `www.` so I'm sticking with that.
2. Tracking
    1. Google deprecated Google Analytics so...I
    2. Setup [umami](https://umami.is/) tracking and that's going great
3. Linking here from LinkedIn
    1. I own the distribution and content! The medium is the message right?
4. Social Media
    1. Removed links to Twitter
    2. Setup Mastodon (I'm still trying to get that green verified box)
    3. Threads
5. Links
    1. Updating links section to focus on personal websites and meetups
