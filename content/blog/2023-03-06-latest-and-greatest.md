Title: It's 2023

It's been nearly three years since I last posted an article so let's do a check in.  

What's changed? 

1. I'm using Firefox. It's fine -- nothing game changing but I like it. 

2. I adopted the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter.
At first I was hesitant because I liked to tweak my code formatting but it's a game changer that eliminates a whole class of problems. 
If you're working on a team I recommend using it.

3. I learned a lot of Elixir with Phoenix and Ecto. Plus some Rust. I like Elixir.

4. I became "Mr. Manager" (Well, manager; we just say manager.) 

This blog is nearly seven years old and other than that things are mostly the same.
I recently saw "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" and this quote comes to mind 

> I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit. There is always a yearning to achieve more. I'll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is. 
-Jiro Ono

That's sort of what I do in data science. 
I apply the same analysis and programming techniques on different data, solving different problems, over and over again. 
Hopefully I'm improving.
