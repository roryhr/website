After a few years in tech you notice trends come and go, seemingly faster and faster every year, like tides in the ocean.

Is everyone who writes code condemned to run on a treadmill struggling to stay in place?
In short, yes. 
Security patches, updates, and best practices are always evolving and it's our job to keep up.

Yet some things have remained.


| Tech    | Year | Comments |
|---------|------|----------|
| SQL     | 1974 | The language for data  |
| Make    | 1976 | Build recipes |
| vi      | 1976 | Still the best text editor |
| ssh     | 1976 | Get in there      |
| Bash    | 1989 | Still the best shell |
| Python  | 1990 | Programming for humans |
| HTTP    | 1991 | Deliver that HTML   |
| HTML    | 1993 | Websites |
| PostgreSQL | 1996 | Excellent database |
| curl    | 1997 | download stuff |
| matplotlib | 2003 | plots |
| git     | 2005 | version control |

These are tools I use every day.
You don't have to be on a treadmill.
