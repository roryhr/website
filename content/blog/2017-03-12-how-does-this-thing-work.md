# Introduction

After 9 months I'm returning to this website.
My first question was "How does this thing work?"
Of course I didn't document it and I don't remember. Lesson learned.

**The things we take for granted are the most important to document.**

This post is for myself and anyone interested in using Pelican to make a Github-hosted website.

# How does this thing work?

## High level overview

This site is hosted for free by [Github](https://github.com/). Thanks Github! The html "code" is a special repository [roryhr/roryhr.github.io](https://github.com/roryhr/roryhr.github.io).

Great. I used a static site generator called Pelican that generates html, which comprises this website, from a series markdown text files in a particular directory structure (more on that in a bit).
These files are in a separate repository at
[roryhr/site-code](https://github.com/roryhr/site-code).

## Recipes

Generate the website

	:::bash
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code$ pelican content
	WARNING: empty slug for /home/rory/Projects/site-code/content/pages/index.md. You can fix this by adding a title or a slug to your content
	Done: Processed 7 articles, 0 drafts, 4 pages and 0 hidden pages in 0.23 seconds.
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code$


Shell showing the output folder is a Git repo pointing to `roryhr/roryhr.github.io`

	:::bash
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code/output$ git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
	Changes not staged for commit:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

		modified:   archives.html
		modified:   author/rory-hartong-redden.html
		modified:   authors.html
		modified:   category/opinion.html

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

		how-does-this-thing-work.html

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code/output$ git remote -v
	origin	https://github.com/roryhr/roryhr.github.io (fetch)
	origin	https://github.com/roryhr/roryhr.github.io (push)
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code/output$

Run the development server manually and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

	:::bash
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code$ cd output/
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code/output$ python -m pelican.server

Alternatively, take advantage of the shell script that automagically recompiles the site as you edit it (very cool!)

	:::bash
	((blog)) rory@rory-Satellite-S75-B:~/Projects/site-code$ ./develop_server.sh start

# Repository contents


	:::bash
	site-code/
		content/
			blog/
				blog-posts-go-here.md
			images/
				images-go-here.jpg
				and-other-static-files.html
			pages/
				about.md
				contact.md
				index.md
				projects.md
		output/
			index.html
			lots of other html files
		render_math/
		develop_server.sh  
		LICENSE
		pelicanconf.py  
		README.md

## Wiring the site up

I made a custom landing page with `pages/index.md` which becomes `index.html`

	:::python
	title:
	save_as: index.html

	Thanks for stopping by my little website.

In `site-code/pelicanconf.py` I wire up the buttons so they're labeled and go to the appropriate place (this took some fiddling).

	:::python
	MENUITEMS = [('Home', '/'),
	             ('Articles', '/archives'),
	             ('About', '/pages/about'),
	             ('Projects', '/pages/projects'),
	             ('Contact', '/pages/contact')]
