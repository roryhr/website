> Fast Radius Raises $48M, With Plans to Double Its Team
> 
> Once the domain of hobbyists and designers, 3D printing has entered the big leagues, and investors are taking notice.
>
> Fast Radius, a Chicago-based digital manufacturing company, announced on Tuesday that it has raised a $48 million Series B round.
>
> Chief Operating Officer Pat McCusker said Fast Radius will use the funding to bolster its software development and physical engineering efforts, build new manufacturing sites and grow its sales team.
>
> “We have about 45 full-time employees, and we expect to double that in the next year or so,” said McCusker. “Most of that growth will happen in Chicago, and we’re really excited about that.”
>
> Founded in 2015, Fast Radius builds industrial-grade components — think airplane parts, medical equipment and custom car parts — using additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.

...
> The technology would also allow airlines and manufacturing companies to print one-off components as needed, as opposed to keeping every machine part that could possibly break in stock. According to McCusker, that would free up billions of dollars invested in components stored around the world.
>
> Logistics titan UPS led Tuesday’s round, in which Drive Capital also participated. Previous investors Jump Capital, Skydeck and Hyde Park Venture Partners partook in Fast Radius’ Series B as well.
> 
> In addition to investing in Fast Radius, UPS has also partnered with the company to build a manufacturing facility at its WorldPort hub in Louisville, KY. The new facility would allow Fast Radius to build and ship parts much faster than it can now.

        The majority of revenue comes from the sale of products, followed by services.

    Cost of Revenue:
        Cost of revenue for 2023 was $1,704, up from $1,348 in 2022 and $977 in 2021.
        The increase corresponds with the rise in total revenue.

        Significant expenses included research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative costs.

        The net loss for 2023 was $22,187, compared to $15,105 in 2022, and $7,082 in 2021.
        The increasing net loss reflects higher operating expenses despite rising revenues.

    Balance Sheet Highlights:

> Fast Radius may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If Fast Radius fails to obtain additional capital on terms that are acceptable, it may not be able to implement such plans for business growth fully, if at all.   	

> Without obtaining adequate capital funding or improving its financial performance, Fast Radius may not be able to continue as a going concern.
 	  	

If demand for Fast Radius’ solutions does not grow as expected, or if market adoption of advanced manufacturing and Fast Radius’ Cloud Manufacturing Platform does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than expected, Fast Radius’ revenues may stagnate or decline, and its business may be adversely affected.
