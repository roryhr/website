Well it's been a while but I'm back at it. 

What have I been doing? 

Enough to keep me busy so without further delay here are the...


# Top Ten Things I've Been Up To

In no particular order, here's a new Top Ten list. 

1. Fish Shell. It's delightful.

2. PySpark

3. Published research! [Real-time Prediction of Intermediate-Horizon Automotive Collision Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01532)

4. Monolithic repos, it's handy to have all *my* code in one folder in one git [repo](https://github.com/roryhr/code). 

5. Gave a [talk on plots](https://youtu.be/LEjLmN0ev5I) at [Pyninsula](http://pyninsula.org/)

6. I got the canonical 3rd Gen 13in MacBook Pro. It's great!

7. [n-gate.com](http://n-gate.com/) is a fun counterpoint to HackerNews. I learned about bikeshedding which puts a name to a phenomenon I'd identified in my "Thought at Hand" post.

9. Refactoring my code following the insights from Trey Hunner's PyCon talk. Slides [here](http://treyhunner.com/readability-counts)

10. Attended the Remedial School of Rock by listening to the classic albums by Led Zeppelin.

11. I ran my first marathon in Dec 2017 in Sacramento at CIM and signed up for the SF Marathon in July. 
My goal is to run 35 miles a week year-round. I missed a few weeks due to illness but I'm logging my miles on Strava.
