Title: Projects

As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll
link to them here.

# Donut Reviews

Since 2014 I've been adding to a personal Facebook album called "Donut Selfies". 
When I visit a new place I look for a mom-and-pop donut shop, try out their wares, and take a bad selfie.
I've been to over 100 donut shops all over the world!
Click the "Donuts" link to see the website and the code is [here](https://github.com/roryhr/code/tree/master/donut_reviews).
This project was an excuse to learn about CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

# How Much Wes Anderson?

Have you spent hours scrolling through [@accidentallywesanderson](https://www.instagram.com/accidentallywesanderson/) on Instagram? 
Do you think his unique aesthetic can quantified? 
Well, yes, I did it!
Check it out.

It was originally on Heroku and now on Fly.
[How Much Wes?](https://falling-dew-7859.fly.dev/)

The code for it is [here](https://github.com/roryhr/code/tree/master/how_much_wes).

# Running Analysis 

I run around 50 miles a week and log those miles on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23193264). 
Sometimes I want to analyze a workout so I made a simple web application on Heroku.
It's a Flask app that makes a couple of Strava API calls and renders some plots but there's gold in them thar plots!

## Self-driving RC car

I want to build a self-driving car and compete here [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/). How hard can it be?

## tune2vec

An idea for an autoencoder that will find an embedding for musical tracks for a music recommendation engine.

## Kaggle

* [Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection),  [code](https://github.com/roryhr/distracted-drivers-keras).
A reinforcement learning-driven hard attention model is ideal. We'll see if I can get it going in time!

* [Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification), [code](https://github.com/roryhr/yelp_kaggle)


## Image Classification Networks

* I invested time studying Convolutional Neural Networks and wrote a Keras model replicating the results for the 2015 state of the art [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03358)
 [Residual Network](https://github.com/roryhr/keras_resnet).


## Data Science Notebooks

* I did some data exploration for Startup.ML on Taxis in Beijing. There are
  neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb).
