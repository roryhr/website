Title: Projects

As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll
link to them here.

# How Much Wes Anderson?

Have you spent hours scrolling through [@accidentallywesanderson](https://www.instagram.com/accidentallywesanderson/) on Instagram? 
Do you think his unique aesthetic can quantified? 
Well, yes, I did it!
Upload an image and check it out.

# Running Analysis 

I run around 50 miles a week and log those miles on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23193264). 
Sometimes I want to analyze a workout so I made a simple web application on Heroku.
It's a Flask app that makes a couple of Strava API calls and renders some plots but there's gold in them thar plots!

## cookiecutter-pyspark

Cookiecutter generates project templates and is a good place to learn best practices. 
I didn't see a PySpark template so I made one.

## Self-driving RC car

I want to build a self-driving car and compete here [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/). How hard can it be?

## tune2vec

An idea for an autoencoder that will find an embedding for musical tracks for a music recommendation engine.

## Kaggle

* [Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection),  [code](https://github.com/roryhr/distracted-drivers-keras).
A reinforcement learning-driven hard attention model is ideal. We'll see if I can get it going in time!

* [Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification), [code](https://github.com/roryhr/yelp_kaggle)


## Image Classification Networks

* I've invested time studying Convolutional Neural Networks and wrote a Keras model for replicating the results for the current (2015) state of the art [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03358)
 [Residual Network](https://github.com/roryhr/keras_resnet).


## Data Science Notebooks

* I did some data exploration for Startup.ML on Taxis in Beijing. There are
  neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb).
