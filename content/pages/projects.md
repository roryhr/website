Title: Projects

As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll
link to them here.

# Activity Title
I like to add creative titles to my Strava activities but creativity comes in bursts, so I 
created a website to store activity names and update "Afternoon Run" to something else when I upload a run.
This was a fun excuse build a Django app, use ChatGPT, and use the Strava webhook.

# Donut Reviews
Since 2014 I've been adding to a personal Facebook album called "Donut Selfies". 
When I visit a new place I look for a mom-and-pop donut shop, try out their wares, and take a bad selfie.
I've been to over 100 donut shops all over the world!
Click the "Donuts" link to see the website and the code is [here](https://github.com/roryhr/code/tree/master/donut_reviews).
This project was an excuse to learn about CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

# How Much Wes Anderson?
Have you spent hours scrolling through [@accidentallywesanderson](https://www.instagram.com/accidentallywesanderson/) on Instagram? 
Do you think his unique aesthetic can quantified? 

Of course it can and I did it! (I'm joking, to be clear -- he's great.)
Check it out.

It was originally on Heroku and now on Flyio.

The code for it is [here](https://github.com/roryhr/how-much-wes).


# Image Classification Networks
I invested time studying Convolutional Neural Networks and wrote a Keras model replicating the results for the 2015 state-of-the-art [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03358)
 [Residual Network](https://github.com/roryhr/keras_resnet).


# Data Science Notebooks
I did some data exploration of Taxi trips in Beijing for Startup.ML.  
There are neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb).
