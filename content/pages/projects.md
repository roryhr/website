title: Projects

As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll
link to them here.

# Self-driving RC car

I want to build a self-driving car and compete here [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/). How hard can it be? haha!

# Research gradient updates

There's been some interesting research into "shattered gradients" which motivates the question, "Can we learn anything by studying the gradient updates in deep neural networks?"

# tune2vec

An idea for an autoencoder that will find an embedding for musical tracks for a music recommendation engine.

# Kaggle

* [Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection),  [code](https://github.com/roryhr/distracted-drivers-keras).
A reinforcement learning-driven hard attention model is ideal. We'll see if I can get it going in time!

* [Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification), [code](https://github.com/roryhr/yelp_kaggle)


# Image Classification Networks

* I've invested time studying Convolutional Neural Networks and wrote a Keras model for replicating the results for the current (2015) state of the art [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03358)
 [Residual Network](https://github.com/roryhr/keras_resnet).


# Data Science Notebooks

* I did some data exploration for Startup.ML on Taxis in Beijing. There are
  neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb)
  on my Github.



# What am I reading?

Unix and SQL are timeless and a great productivity investment. Lately I'm working with larger amounts of data where it's more comfortable in the Hadoop ecosystem.

* The Unix Programming Environment

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

* Hadoop: The Definitive Guide: Storage and Analysis at Internet Scale 

* Database Systems: The Complete Book
