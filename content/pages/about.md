# Long Bio

Rory Hartong-Redden is a Researcher at Allstate working on an autonomous vehicle research project with Stanford.
The project was described in a recent [press release](https://www.allstatenewsroom.com/news/allstate-announces-autonomous-vehicle-research-agreement/) and is off to a great start.

The winter of 2015 he was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML).
There Rory worked in an agile team, built a data pipeline to ingest market data, and set up a platform to test trading algorithms.

His master’s work built a new fluid dynamics experiment that measured fluid motion using a novel computer vision system.
Similarly, Rory's bachelor’s work pioneered a measurement technique that collected data from splashes from two high-speed cameras.
Lacking a theory to draw conclusions from the data he developed a new theory of patterns on circular domains.

He can be found on running paths around Stanford and at Meetup groups in the Bay Area discussing the latest advances in AI and Python.
