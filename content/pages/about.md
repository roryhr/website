Title: About

Rory Hartong-Redden is a data scientist and engineer currently in California. 
He's worked with lots of data primarily with Python, Spark, and Hadoop. 


# Long Bio

Rory Hartong-Redden was born in Los Angeles, grew up in the Bay Area, and visits his parents on the Central Coast. 
For a change of scenery he moved from Silicon Valley to Linz, Austria.

Prior to joining Runtastic Rory Hartong-Redden was a Data Scientist at Allstate in Menlo Park, CA. 
While at Allstate he collaborated with the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab on autonomous vehicle safety.
The project was described in a recent [press release](https://www.allstatenewsroom.com/news/allstate-announces-autonomous-vehicle-research-agreement/) and has resulted in several publications.

During the winter quarter of 2015 he was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML) where he built a data pipeline to Bitcoin data and set up a platform to backtest trading algorithms. 
Unfortunately he did anticipate Bitcoin blowing up the way it did.

Rory earned two bachelors degrees in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. 
His undergraduate research studied the structure of splashed using stereo high-speed cameras.
Rory completed a masters in Mechanical Engineering and continued to work in experimental fluid dynamics where he built a new fluid dynamics experiment that measured fluid motion using a novel computer vision system.
