Title: About

Rory Hartong-Redden is Data Engineer/Data Scientist. My tools of choice are Python and PySpark.
I work at Runtastic in Linz, Austria (acquired by Adidas).

# Long Bio

Rory Hartong-Redden, it's fair to say, is a native Californian. 
He was born in Los Angeles, grew up in the Bay Area, and visits his parents on the Central Coast. 
For a change of scenery he moved from Silicon Valley to Linz, Austria.

Prior to joining Runtastic Rory Hartong-Redden was a Data Scientist at Allstate in Menlo Park, CA. 
While at Allstate he collaborated with the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab on autonomous vehicle safety.
The project was described in a recent [press release](https://www.allstatenewsroom.com/news/allstate-announces-autonomous-vehicle-research-agreement/) and has resulted in several publications.

During the winter quarter of 2015 he was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML) where he built a data pipeline to Bitcoin data and set up a platform to backtest trading algorithms. 
Unfortunately he did anticipate Bitcoin blowing up the way it did (any model that held onto Bitcoin would have been profitable!).

Rory earned a bachelors degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. 
His undergraduate research studied the structure of splashed using stereo high-speed cameras.
Rory completed a masters in Mechanical Engineering and continued to work in experimental fluid dynamics where he built a new fluid dynamics experiment that measured fluid motion using a novel computer vision system.
