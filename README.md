# Website Code

Here's code for my static website that is hosted on Github. 
I use the Pelican to generate the html from markdown files. 


`make dev` starts a local server that watches the `content/` and sends HTML to the `output/` folder. 
Browse at http://localhost:8000/


The output is hosted in a separate git repo at 
https://github.com/roryhr/roryhr.github.io
